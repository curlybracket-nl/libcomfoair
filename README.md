# libcomfoair üå¨Ô∏è

This library is 100% TypeScript-based, written from scratch, and strongly typed, making it easier to develop reliable and maintainable applications.

`libcomfoair` is a TypeScript library for interacting with Zehnder ComfoAirQ ventilation units via the Zehnder ComfoConnect LAN C gateway (sometimes also referred to as ComfoControl). It allows you to discover these gateways on your network, read and write properties, and listen for property changes on ComfoAirQ units.

## Features ‚ú®

- üîç Discover Zehnder ComfoConnect LAN C gateways on the same network.
- üìñ Read and write properties of Zehnder ComfoAirQ devices.
- üîÑ Listen for property changes on ComfoAirQ units.
- ‚öôÔ∏è TypeScript-based, ensuring reliable development using strong types.

## Installation üì¶

```bash
npm install libcomfoair
```

## Usage üöÄ

### Discovering Devices üîç

To discover Zehnder ComfoConnect LAN C gateways on your network, use the `discoveryOperation` function. Note that the gateway must be on the same network as the device performing the discovery. The discovery operation can be awaited and also emits events.

```typescript
import { ComfoControlClient } from 'libcomfoair';

// Awaiting discovery using a promise
// When a limit is set the discovery stops once the limit is reached
// Otherwise it continues for the set timeout 
ComfoControlClient.discover({ limit: 1 }).then(devices => {
  console.log('Discovered devices:', devices);
  if (devices.length > 0) {
    const client = new ComfoControlClient(devices[0]);
    // For example, retrieve server time 
    client.getServerTime().then(time => {
      console.log(`Got server time: ${time}`);
    });
  }
});

// Listening to discovery events
const discovery = ComfoControlClient.discover({ limit: 1 });
discovery.on('discover', device => {
  console.log('Discovered device:', device);
});
discovery.on('completed', () => {
  console.log('Discovery finished');
});
```

### Listening for Property Changes üîÑ

You can listen for property changes on a ComfoAirQ unit by registering property listeners. Make sure you connect the client first:

```typescript
import { ComfoControlClient, ComfoAirProperties } from 'libcomfoair';
import { ComfoControlServerInfo } from 'libcomfoair'; // Example import

async function main() {
  const serverInfo: ComfoControlServerInfo = {
    ip: 'device-ip-address',
    port: 80,
    // ...other fields...
  };

  const client = new ComfoControlClient(serverInfo);

  // Register a listener for OUTDOOR_AIR_TEMPERATURE
  await client.registerPropertyListener(ComfoAirProperties.OUTDOOR_AIR_TEMPERATURE, ({ value }) => {
    console.log(`Outdoor air temperature: ${value / 10} ¬∞C`);
  });

  // Register a listener for SUPPLY_AIR_TEMPERATURE
  await client.registerPropertyListener(ComfoAirProperties.SUPPLY_AIR_TEMPERATURE, ({ value }) => {
    console.log(`Supply air temperature: ${value / 10} ¬∞C`);
  });

  // Finally connect the client
  // This will start a session and begin receiving property updates
  await client.getServerTime(); // Example request
}
```

## How Device Discovery Works üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The discovery of Zehnder ComfoConnect LAN C gateways works by sending a broadcast message on the network and waiting for responses. For the discovery to work, the gateway must be on the same network as the device performing the discovery.

## Strongly Typed Library

This library is strongly typed, providing full autocomplete functionality for known ComfoAirQ properties and message types. It makes interacting with the ComfoControl LAN-C bridge more straightforward and reliable. By leveraging TypeScript‚Äôs type system, you benefit from enhanced code completion, reduced runtime errors, and more precise typings when dealing with ComfoAirQ properties and messages.
